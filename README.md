Functional javascript, data structures &amp; algorithms

- Recursion
  - What is recursion
  - Example of recursion
  - Tracing recursion
  - Stack is used in recursion
  - Time complexity
  - Recurrence relation
- Types
  - Linear recursion
    - Tail recursion - calling itself and that call is last statement in function
    - Head recursion
  - Tree recursion
    - function calling itself more than 1 time is tree recursion
  - ## Indirect Recursion
  - Nested recursion
    - Recursion inside recursion
- Excessive Recursion
  - memoization - storing the results when excessive recursion
- Array Data Structures - ADT
  - Data: array space, size, length
  - Operations: display, add, append, delete, search, get, set, max, reverse, shift, rotate
  - Linear search
    - transposition - element found move it 1 step forward
    - move to front/head -
  - ## Binary search - need to be sorted
- Lists
  - List ADT
    listSize
    pos
    length
    clear
    toString
    getElement
    insert
    append
    remove
    front
    end
    previous
    next
    hasPrevious
    hasNext
    currPos
    moveTo
